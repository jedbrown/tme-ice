\opening{Dear Editor,}

The enclosed manuscript presents a new optimal parallel solver for the hydrostatic equations of ice sheet dymanics.
Poor algorithmic and parallel scalability of existing solvers is the primary reason why less complete physical models are used by today's production continental-scale ice sheet models.
The methods in this paper can solve the equations orders of magnitude faster than existing methods and exhibit optimal parallel scalability.
This enables numerical simulation at much higher resolution and with faster turn-around time than existing methods.
We believe this capability has potential for large impact on high-resolution numerical simulation of ice sheets with ice streams and outlet glaciers, such as was called for by the last IPCC assessment report.
Although the material is more computational than typical for this journal, we believe it is relevant to readers of JGR Earth Surface.
Please consider this article for publication.

\closing{Sincerely,\\
