If you have git-1.6.5 or later, you can clone this repository with

  git clone --recursive git://github.com/jedbrown/tme-ice.git

and all the submodules will be available.  With earlier versions, you
need to clone and then run

  git submodule init
  git submodule update

If you use a very old version of git, you may need to clone the
repositories listed in .gitmodules manually.  Then

  ./make.sh figures
  ./make.sh pdf
